    <h1>What is Full Stack Web development.</h1>
    <p>Full stack web development refers to the ability to develop both the front-end and back-end components of a web application. A full stack web developer possesses the skills and knowledge to work with both the client-side and server-side technologies. On the front-end, they are proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allow them to create the user interface and ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. They are also well-versed in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, which provide tools and libraries for building dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>

    <p>On the back-end, a full stack web developer is skilled in server-side programming languages such as Python, JavaScript (Node.js), or Ruby, enabling them to handle server logic, database integration, and business logic implementation. They are familiar with frameworks like Django, Express.js, or Ruby on Rails, which facilitate rapid development and provide efficient solutions for handling server requests, data storage, and authentication. Additionally, full stack developers are knowledgeable about databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, and understand how to interact with them through query languages like SQL or NoSQL.</p>
