    <h1><mark><u>What is Frontend?</u></mark></h1>
    <p>Frontend development refers to the practice of creating and implementing the user-facing part of a website or application. It involves the design and development of the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with directly. Frontend developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, layout, and functionality of a website's frontend.</p>

    <p>In the frontend development process, designers provide the visual mockups or wireframes, and frontend developers bring those designs to life by writing code. They use HTML to create the structure of the webpage, defining the content and layout. CSS is then used to style the HTML elements, applying colors, fonts, and other visual properties. JavaScript is employed to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website, enabling features like animations, form validation, and data retrieval from servers.</p>

    <h1><mark><u>What is Backend?</u></mark></h1>
    <p>Backend development refers to the creation and management of the server-side components of a website or application. It focuses on building the underlying infrastructure, databases, and logic that enable the frontend to function. Backend developers work with server-side programming languages such as Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js, as well as frameworks and technologies like Django, Spring, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js to handle data processing, server communication, and business logic.</p>

    <p>In backend development, the primary goal is to handle data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Backend developers design and implement databases to store and organize the application's data efficiently. They create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, allowing data exchange and enabling various functionalities. Additionally, backend development involves implementing security measures, performance optimization, and scalability to ensure the application can handle increasing traffic and user demand.</p>

    <h1><mark><u>What is Full Stack Development?</u></mark></h1>
    <p>Full stack web development refers to the ability to work on both the frontend and backend aspects of a web application. A full stack web developer has proficiency in both client-side and server-side technologies, enabling them to handle all layers of the application development process. They possess a diverse skill set and are capable of independently building a complete web application from start to finish.</p>
